# About Me
Hi there! My name is Meghan Kolin (she/they) and I'm a fourth-year urban studies and human geography student at the University of Toronto.

My experience with coding/development is pretty limited, but I'm very excited to get to know the space further. Currently, I am learning how to work with **HTML** and **JavaScript**, particularly their intersection with web mapping. However, I am always excited to learn new things and hope to add a few more programming languages and skills to my repertoire over the years.

When I'm not in class or working on something for school, I run an a cappella group on campus. I also enjoy getting lost in the depths of Google Maps.

Links to my LinkedIn profile and other relevant things coming soon!
